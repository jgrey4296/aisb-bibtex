# What?

The [AISB](https://aisb.org.uk) have put their [Convention Proceedings](https://aisb.org.uk/convention-proceedings/) up online.
However, apart from the ACM digital library having the metadata for [1980](https://dl.acm.org/doi/proceedings/10.5555/3069422),
[1978](https://dl.acm.org/doi/proceedings/10.5555/3017065), [1976](https://dl.acm.org/doi/proceedings/10.5555/3015508),
and [1974](https://dl.acm.org/doi/proceedings/10.5555/3015486), metadata for the rest are lacking.

So I've gone through and made some bibtex for them (2000 - 2023).

# Notes
This isn't complete, the todo.org file tracks where I'm at.
For Readability, files are written as UTF-8, and non-ascii characters are used.
If you are going to feed these into bibtex, you would want to run a unicode -> latex convertor first.
