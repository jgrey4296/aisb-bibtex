Yet chess players employ a wide variety of evaluative terms, distinguishing (for example) a "drawn" from a "balanced" position, a "decisive" from a "slight" advantage, and a "blunder" from a "mistake".As an extension of the classical theory, a model of fallible play is developed. Using this, two quantities can in principle be associated with each position, its "game-theoretic value" and its "expected utility". A function of these two variables can be found which yields interpretations of many evaluative terns used by chess commentators.},

 abstract     = {The Planner Project is constructing a Programming Apprentice to assist in knowledge based programming. We would like to provide an environment which has substantial knowledge of the semantic domain for which the programs are being written, and knowledge of the purposes that the programs are supposed to satisfy. Further, we would like to make it easy for the programmer to communicate the knowledge about the program to the Apprentice. The Apprentice is to aid in establishing and maintaining consistency of specifications, validating that modules meet their specifications, answering questions about behavioral dependencies between modules, and analyzing the implications of perturbations in modules and their specifications.A tenet of the apprentice project is that programming is a multi-level activity: as well as writing code, programmers communicate in terms of comments and models. Our goal is to elucidate and formalize some of these interactions. The first level of description we have attacked is the level of abstract descriptions of what programs do, rather than how they do it. The contracts and intentions discussed in this paper are an attempt to embody this kind of knowledge in a formal and yet intuitive and useful way. A process known as meta-evaluation is presented which can justify why a program fulfills its contract. Further research is being carried out into the role of models, background knowledge, and commentary relating these different levels of description.This work is presented using Actors, a semantic concept in which no active process is ever allowed to treat anything as an object; instead a polite request must be extended to accomplish what the activator desires.},
