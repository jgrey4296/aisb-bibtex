By applying the refinement rules in its knowledge base, PECOS constructs a refinement tree: the root is the abstract specification, each leaf is an alternative implementation, and each path is a different sequence of rule applications.

It is proved that undefined(n) can be computed by solving an auxiliary problem, obtained from the original one, by adding new arcs, and of smaller complexity than that one.

We show that many of the incorrect strategies used by schoolchildren can be modelled as the consequences of simple changes to this production system, such as the omission of individual rules or the addition of rules appropriate for other arithmetical tasks.},

Lastly, the programming methodologies of software engineering appear to be most closely akin to the current inquiry, and this contention is examined.},

 abstract     = {A sequence of TV-frames is recorded from a real-world scene. In order to determine motion attributes of objects the segmentation of these (digitized) TV-frames has to provide a reliable symbolic description for each image. The complexity of light intensity distribution along object surfaces in such scenes calls for a method which can extract regions according to various criteria. The algorithm presented here transforms the grayvalue matrix into a vector field, the vector components describing small local planes fitted to the grayvalue image. A three-level filter process uses parameterized constraints to remove inconsistent nodes and arcs from a graph which represents the vector field. Nodes are associated with vectors, arcs are initialized to connect adjacent vectors. A region is associated with an isolated graph component, its features are computed from the vectors in the component. Comparison of features establishes correspondence of regions originating from the same object surface in different frames. These region sequences serve as a basis for object description, especially its motion state.},

To understand a sentence within a given story, we reduce the information it carries, This reduction gives way to the application of a few rules for character behaviour, whose aim is to connect the sentence to another onp by establishing some causal relationship between desires and actions. The system can then answer "why" questions and questions about some facts not explicitly described in the story.The natural language used is French, the program is written in SIMULA},
